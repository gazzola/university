Part-of-speech Tagging consists in classify a given word that belongs to a colections of texts in particular part of speech tag, based in its context. Despite much methods already been proposeds to this task, in Natural Language Processing we are always looking for improvement, because Part-of-speech Tagging can be used in many aplications. We study different methods to generate word representation (word embeddings) from a colection of texts denomined corpora. We create a deep learning model by using a recurrent neural network that recieves as input the word embeddings and predicts a part-of-speech tag to that word. The neural model is guided, where easy words to classify are aplieds firts in the network. The ouput is a vector tag, that is then complemented with the input of the same word classified. The training process occur over three diferent tagged corpora for brasilian portuguese.
