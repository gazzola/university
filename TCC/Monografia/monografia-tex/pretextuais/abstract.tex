\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 
Part-of-speech Tagging consists in classify a given word, that belongs to a collections of texts, with particular part of speech tag. Part-of-speech Tagging can be used as pre-processing of many applications, so, in Natural Language Processing we are always searching for improvement methods. We study different methods to generate words representations (word embeddings) from a collection of texts denominated corpora. We propose a deep learning model by using a recursive neural network that receives as input the word embeddings and predicts a part-of-speech tag to the associated word. The neural model is guided, where easy words to predict are classified first. The output of the network is a vector tag, that is then complemented with the input vector of the same word classified. The training process occur over three different tagged corpora for brazilian portuguese.
