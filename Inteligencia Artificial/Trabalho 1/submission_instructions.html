<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

<!--announcements-->

<h3>Class Accounts and Submitting Assignments </h3>
<p>This page contains instructions on <a href="#setup">setting up your class account</a>, <a href="#submitting">submitting assignments</a>, and <a href="#scores">checking scores</a>. </p>
<p> <font color="red">Here because you don't have a <code>partners.txt</code> file?</font>  Jump to <a href="#submitting">these instructions</a>.


<h4><a name="setup"></a>Setting Up Your Class Account</h4>
<p><ol>
  <li><strong>Acquire a class account form</strong> (handed out during the first two lectures and in section)</li>
  <li><strong>Register your  account</strong><br>
    You should be asked your name and SID the first time you log in. If you are not sure whether this has happened, run the following program from the command line<br>
    <br>
    <code>check-register</code><br>

    <br>
    to check your class registration information. (Note: This is *not* the University class enrollment system. If you have any question about whether you are officially enrolled in the class, check the tele-bears system.)<br>
    <br>
    If this script returns no information run <br>
    <br>
    <code>register</code><br>
    <br>

    If this information is incorrect run <br>
    <br>
    <code>re-register</code><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Special instructions for setting up named accounts:</h4>
<p>If you are using a named account for the class (e.g. bbrown), here are <br>
  extra steps you need to follow (for the class 'cs188', for example):<br>

  <br>
  1. edit your .cshrc file to include the following three lines:<br>
  <br>
  <code>setenv MASTERDIR /home/ff/cs188<br>
  set path=(/share/b/grading/bin $path)<br>
  alias glookup /share/b/grading/bin/glookup</code><br>
  <br>

  2. type<br>
  <br>
  <code>source .cshrc</code><br>
  <br>
  3. type<br>
  <br>
  <code>register</code><br>

  <br>
  If you are using your named account for more than one class that uses the<br>
  grading utilities, you will have to issue the setenv and alias commands <br>
  at the command line (setenv MASTERDIR /home/ff/classname; alias glookup<br>
  /home/ff/classname/bin/arch/`uname -m`/glookup) to point the grading <br>
utilities to the correct class master account.</p>
<h4><a name="submitting"></a>Submitting Programming Assignments</h4>

<p>Each assignment has a name in the grading system (like <code>p0</code>, <code>p1</code>, etc.). To submit an assignment, change to the directory containing the assignment (using cd) and type <code>submit &lt;ASSIGNMENT-NAME&gt;</code>. For example:</p>
<p><code>submit p0</code><br>
  <br>
  A submission should consist of:
  <ul type="square">
  <li>-<strong>A file called <code>partners.txt</code></strong>. This file should contain a list of all participants in the submission, <b>including the submitter</b>. Each line should take the form:


<p>
<code>[class id],[email],[name]</code>
<p>

for example,

<p><code>cs188-ir,john.mctest@gmail.com,John Q. McTest</code><p>

  The email address given should be one that you check frequently. The grading system will communicate with you (and your partners, if any) via the emails provided, so please give an email which you will check frequently.
  Submit this file, even when you do an assignment alone, or the autograder will complain.  Why? If we do not have an email address for you, the grading system cannot inform you if anything has gone wrong.

 <li>-All files <b>which have been edited as part of the submission</b>. In general, we will provide support files (code and/or data) for each project which you should not change. The grading system may complain if you try to submit these files.
 </ul>
  <p>Upon submission, the grading system will perform a few sanity checks to ensure that your submission succeeded. We will check the following conditions:
  <p>

  <ul>
  <li>-A <code>partners.txt</code> file is present</li>
  <li>-No support files have been edited</li>
  <li>-Your code runs without producing an exception</li>
  <li>-Your code passes some simple test cases. We will provide these for each project</li>

</ul>
  <p>If all of the above hold, you (and all others listed in <code>partners.txt</code>) will receive a confirmation email within 15 minutes. If you do not receive an email, first check that your <code>partners.txt</code> file is well-formed and has been submitted. If you still receive no confirmation email, then please contact us.
  If the grading system encounters an error, you will receive an email explaining what went wrong. If you cannot discern the source of the problem from the error message, please contact us.

  <p><strong>Please be careful when submitting projects.</strong> Your last submission will be the one graded. If you have a partner, the last submission from either partner's account will be graded.</p>


<h5><a name="optional_files"></a>Submitting Optional Files</h5> 
<p>By default, <code>submit</code> will only grab <code>partners.txt</code> and whatever file(s) we tell you to submit. However, you can submit other files if you wish.
To do this, you must say <code>no</code> when <code>submit</code> gives you this prompt:
 

<p><code>The files you have submitted are:
        <br>./foo.py ./partners.txt 
<br>Is this correct? [yes/no]</code> 
 
<p><code>submit</code> will then ask you to name additional files. 


<h4><a name="scores"></a>Checking Your Scores</h4>
<p>To look up your grades run the following program from the command line: <br>
  <br>
  <code>glookup</code></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
